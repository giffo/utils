###giffo-utils

my node.js utils, functions i always seem to need,

when I get time I will list the functions for my own memory
in the next commit

I have a function called `.builtins()` that will mess up everything the world has ever known as good. and God forbid you use `.tick(fn)`

	var utils = require("giffo-utils");





###TODO:

*sort out the tick function, list all the functions and think about a file copy using mkdir if the directory path does not fully exist*
